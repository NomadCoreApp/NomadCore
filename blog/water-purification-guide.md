# 5 Ways to Purify Water in an Emergency: Which Method is Right for You?

**Reading time:** 6 minutes

Water is life. In a survival situation, you can last weeks without food but only three days without water. The problem? Not all water is safe to drink.

Lakes, streams, and even rainwater can contain bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemical contaminants that cause everything from mild stomach upset to life-threatening illness. Drinking contaminated water when you're already in a survival situation can turn a bad day into a fatal one.

The good news: purifying water isn't complicated. Here are five proven methods—each with different strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases.

## Method 1: Boiling

**The gold standard of water purification.**

Boiling is the oldest, most reliable method of making water safe to drink. Heat kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause waterborne illness.

### How to Do It

1. Collect water in a heat-safe container
2. Bring to a rolling boil
3. Maintain boil for **1 minute** (or 3 minutes above 6,500 feet elevation)
4. Let cool before drinking

### Pros
- Kills virtually all pathogens
- No special equipment needed (just fire and a container)
- Works on any water source
- Free (if you have fuel)

### Cons
- Requires fire or heat source
- Uses fuel (which may be limited)
- Takes time to boil AND cool
- Doesn't remove chemicals, heavy metals, or sediment
- Water tastes flat (no dissolved oxygen)

### Best For
- Base camp situations where you have time and fuel
- When you're certain the water is only biologically contaminated
- Backup method when other options fail

**Pro tip:** Improve flat-tasting boiled water by pouring it back and forth between two containers to re-oxygenate it.

## Method 2: Purification Tablets

**Lightweight, portable, and effective.**

Chemical purification tablets use iodine, chlorine, or chlorine dioxide to kill pathogens. They're a favorite among backpackers and emergency preppers for good reason.

### How to Use Them

1. Fill container with water
2. Add tablet according to package directions (usually 1 tablet per liter)
3. Wait the specified time (30 minutes to 4 hours depending on type)
4. Drink

### Types of Tablets

| Type | Wait Time | Taste | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Chlorine dioxide** | 30 min - 4 hours | Minimal | Excellent (kills Cryptosporidium) |
| **Iodine** | 30 minutes | Noticeable | Good (doesn't kill Crypto) |
| **Chlorine** | 30 minutes | Slight | Good (doesn't kill Crypto) |

### Pros
- Extremely lightweight and portable
- Long shelf life (5+ years unopened)
- Inexpensive
- No power or fuel needed
- Easy to use

### Cons
- Wait time required
- Chemical taste (especially iodine)
- Some don't kill Cryptosporidium
- Less effective in cold or murky water
- Iodine not recommended for pregnant women or those with thyroid issues

### Best For
- Bug-out bags and emergency kits
- Backpacking and hiking
- Backup to primary purification method

**Pro tip:** Chlorine dioxide tablets (like Aquamira or Katadyn Micropur) are worth the extra cost—they kill everything including Crypto, with minimal taste.

## Method 3: UV Light (SteriPEN)

**High-tech purification in your pocket.**

UV purifiers use ultraviolet light to destroy the DNA of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, rendering them unable to reproduce and cause illness.

### How to Use It

1. Fill a clear container with water
2. Insert UV device
3. Stir for the specified time (usually 60-90 seconds per liter)
4. Drink immediately

### Pros
- Fast (under 2 minutes)
- No chemical taste
- Kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites
- Reusable (batteries or rechargeable)
- Lightweight

### Cons
- Requires batteries or power
- Only works in clear water (sediment blocks UV)
- Doesn't remove particles or chemicals
- Electronic device can fail
- More expensive upfront

### Best For
- Travel to developing countries
- Clear water sources
- When speed matters
- Tech-savvy users who maintain their gear

**Pro tip:** Always carry backup purification (tablets) in case your UV device fails or batteries die.

## Method 4: Solar Disinfection (SODIS)

**Free purification using only sunlight.**

The SODIS method uses UV radiation from the sun to kill pathogens. It's been promoted by the World Health Organization for areas without access to clean water.

### How to Do It

1. Fill clear plastic bottles (PET plastic, 2 liters or smaller)
2. If cloudy, filter through cloth first
3. Lay bottles horizontally in direct sunlight
4. Wait **6 hours** in full sun (or 2 days if cloudy)
5. Drink

### Pros
- Completely free
- No equipment beyond plastic bottles
- No fuel or batteries needed
- Effective against bacteria and viruses

### Cons
- Slow (6+ hours minimum)
- Requires direct sunlight
- Less effective against parasites like Crypto
- Doesn't work with glass or scratched bottles
- Limited volume (small bottles only)

### Best For
- Long-term survival situations
- When no other options available
- Supplementing other methods
- Developing world applications

**Pro tip:** Paint one side of the bottle black or place bottles on a dark or reflective surface to increase UV absorption and effectiveness.

## Method 5: Portable Filters

**Physical removal of contaminants.**

Portable filters force water through microscopic pores that physically trap bacteria, parasites, and sediment. Higher-end models include activated carbon for chemical removal.

### Types of Filters

| Type | Flow Rate | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Straw filters** (LifeStraw) | Sip | Personal, emergency |
| **Squeeze filters** (Sawyer) | Moderate | Backpacking, small groups |
| **Pump filters** (MSR, Katadyn) | High | Groups, base camp |
| **Gravity filters** | Hands-free | Camp, groups |

### Pros
- Immediate results (no waiting)
- Removes sediment and particles
- No batteries or fuel
- Good filters remove bacteria and parasites
- Some include carbon for taste/chemicals

### Cons
- Most filters DON'T remove viruses
- Filters can clog (need maintenance)
- Heavier than tablets
- Can freeze and crack in winter
- Eventually need replacement

### Best For
- Backpacking and camping
- Areas with bacteria/parasite risk (not virus)
- Murky water (filters clean it)
- When you need water NOW

**Pro tip:** In areas where viruses are a concern (human waste contamination), use a filter for clarity THEN treat with tablets or UV.

## What Should You Carry?

For most emergency preparedness, we recommend a **two-method approach**:

### Primary: Portable Filter
- Immediate water access
- Clears sediment
- Reusable

### Backup: Purification Tablets
- Lightweight redundancy
- Handles viruses
- Works if filter fails

This combination covers nearly every scenario while keeping weight manageable.

## The Cardinal Rule

**When in doubt, purify.**

Clear, flowing mountain stream? Purify it.
Rainwater from a clean container? Purify it.
Water from a public tap in a disaster? Purify it.

Waterborne illness can incapacitate you within hours. The few minutes spent purifying water is always worth it.

---

## Water Sources to Avoid

Even purification has limits. Avoid these when possible:

- Water with chemical contamination (industrial runoff, agricultural areas)
- Water near animal carcasses
- Stagnant water with algae blooms
- Flood water (contains sewage, chemicals, debris)
- Salt water (purification doesn't remove salt)

If these are your only options, purify AND filter through cloth, and understand the risks.

## Build Your Water Strategy

Your 72-hour kit should include:

- [ ] 3 gallons stored water per person
- [ ] Portable filter (like Sawyer Squeeze)
- [ ] Purification tablets (chlorine dioxide)
- [ ] Metal container for boiling (backup method)

With these four elements, you're prepared for any water situation short of apocalyptic chemical contamination.

**Be Prepared. Stay Safe. Live Free.**
