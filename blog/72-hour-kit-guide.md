# The Complete 72-Hour Kit Guide: What You Actually Need to Survive

**Reading time:** 6 minutes

When disaster strikes, you have minutes—not hours—to grab what you need and go. Whether it's a wildfire, hurricane, or unexpected evacuation order, the difference between chaos and calm often comes down to one thing: preparation.

A 72-hour kit (also called a bug-out bag or go-bag) contains everything you need to survive for three days without outside help. Why 72 hours? That's typically how long it takes for emergency services to establish relief operations after a major disaster.

Here's how to build one that actually works.

## The Foundation: Water and Food

**Water** is your most critical supply. The human body can survive weeks without food but only days without water.

- **1 gallon per person per day** (3 gallons total per person)
- Store in sturdy, portable containers
- Include water purification tablets or a filter as backup
- Replace stored water every 6 months

**Food** should be non-perishable, calorie-dense, and require no cooking.

- Canned goods (beans, tuna, vegetables)
- Energy bars and granola
- Dried fruit and nuts
- Peanut butter
- Crackers

**Pro tip:** Don't forget a manual can opener. It's a small item that becomes critical when you're staring at a can of beans with no way to open it.

## First Aid: Beyond the Basics

A basic first aid kit is essential, but most pre-made kits are designed for minor cuts, not emergencies. Upgrade yours with:

**Standard items:**
- Adhesive bandages (various sizes)
- Sterile gauze pads and medical tape
- Antiseptic wipes
- Tweezers and scissors
- Pain relievers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)

**Emergency additions:**
- Tourniquet (and know how to use it)
- Israeli bandage or pressure dressing
- QuikClot or hemostatic gauze
- SAM splint
- Burn gel packets
- Any prescription medications (rotate every 3 months)

**Important:** A first aid kit is only as good as your knowledge. Take a basic first aid course—many are free through the Red Cross.

## Light, Power, and Communication

When the grid goes down, you need alternatives.

**Lighting:**
- LED flashlight (with extra batteries)
- Headlamp (keeps hands free)
- Emergency candles and waterproof matches
- Glow sticks (safe, no fire risk)

**Power:**
- Hand-crank or solar radio (NOAA weather bands)
- Portable phone charger (keep it charged)
- Extra batteries in common sizes (AA, AAA)

**Communication:**
- Fully charged cell phone
- Written list of emergency contacts
- Local area map (phones die, paper doesn't)
- Whistle for signaling

The hand-crank radio is non-negotiable. When cell towers are down and the internet is out, NOAA weather radio may be your only source of official information.

## Shelter and Warmth

You can't always count on finding shelter. Pack items that let you create your own.

- Emergency Mylar blankets (compact, retain 90% of body heat)
- Wool blanket (warm even when wet)
- Tarp or emergency tent
- Paracord (50 feet minimum)
- Hand warmers
- Rain poncho

**Clothing to include:**
- Complete change of clothes
- Sturdy shoes or boots
- Hat and gloves
- Extra socks (feet are critical)

Hypothermia can occur in temperatures as high as 50°F if you're wet and exposed. Don't underestimate shelter.

## Documents and Cash

In an evacuation, you may need to prove who you are without access to the internet.

**Keep copies of:**
- Driver's license or ID
- Passport
- Insurance policies (home, auto, health)
- Bank account information
- Medical records and prescriptions
- Emergency contact list
- Recent photos of family members

**Store these:**
- In a waterproof bag or container
- As physical copies AND on a USB drive
- Consider a fireproof document bag

**Cash:** Keep $200-500 in small bills. ATMs don't work without power, and card readers fail during outages.

---

## Tools and Miscellaneous

The items that don't fit a category but prove invaluable:

- Multi-tool or knife
- Duct tape (wrap around a pencil to save space)
- Work gloves
- N95 masks (dust, smoke, debris)
- Garbage bags (waterproofing, waste, emergency poncho)
- Zip ties
- Notepad and pen
- Deck of cards (morale matters)

**Sanitation:**
- Toilet paper
- Hand sanitizer
- Wet wipes
- Feminine hygiene products
- Plastic bags for waste

## Special Considerations

### For Families with Children
- Diapers and formula (if applicable)
- Comfort items (small toy, blanket)
- Children's medications
- Games or activities
- Copy of custody documents

### For Pet Owners
- Pet food (3-day supply)
- Collapsible water bowl
- Leash and carrier
- Vaccination records
- Recent photo of pet

### For Those with Medical Needs
- 7-day supply of medications (minimum)
- Medical equipment and batteries
- List of doctors and pharmacies
- Medical alert information
- Backup glasses or contacts

---

## Choosing the Right Bag

Your container matters. A 72-hour kit needs to be:

- **Portable:** You should be able to carry it for extended periods
- **Durable:** It may get thrown in a truck bed or dropped
- **Accessible:** You need to find items quickly

A quality hiking backpack (40-60 liters) works well for most people. Avoid suitcases—wheels don't work on debris-covered roads.

**Weight guideline:** Your packed kit should be no more than 20% of your body weight if you expect to move quickly.

---

## Storage and Maintenance

A kit you can't find or that's expired is useless.

**Storage:**
- Keep it somewhere accessible (not the attic)
- Near an exit door or in your vehicle
- Tell family members where it is

**Maintenance schedule:**
- **Monthly:** Check flashlight batteries
- **Quarterly:** Rotate medications, check food dates
- **Biannually:** Replace water, update documents
- **Annually:** Full inventory and replacement of expired items

## Start Today, Not Tomorrow

The best time to build a 72-hour kit was yesterday. The second-best time is now.

You don't need to buy everything at once. Start with water and first aid. Add food next week. Build your kit over a month, and you'll have peace of mind that lasts for years.

Disasters don't announce themselves. But when the alert hits your phone at 3 AM, you'll be ready.

**Be Prepared. Stay Safe. Live Free.**
