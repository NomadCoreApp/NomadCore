# Power Outage Survival: What to Do When the Lights Go Out

**Reading time:** 6 minutes

The lights flicker. Then darkness. Whether it's a summer storm, winter ice, or grid failure, power outages happen without warning—and they're happening more frequently. The U.S. experienced over 1,500 major outages in 2024 alone, affecting millions of households.

Most outages last a few hours. Some last days. A few have lasted weeks. The difference between inconvenience and crisis often comes down to preparation.

Here's everything you need to know to keep your family safe, comfortable, and informed when the power goes out.

## The First 5 Minutes

When the power cuts, take these immediate steps:

### 1. Stay Calm and Assess
- Check if it's just your home (look outside for neighbor's lights)
- Check your circuit breaker—it might be a simple fix
- If it's widespread, it's a utility outage

### 2. Unplug Sensitive Electronics
- Computers, TVs, gaming systems
- Prevents damage from power surge when electricity returns
- Leave one lamp plugged in so you know when power's back

### 3. Grab Your Light Sources
- Flashlights first (safer than candles)
- Headlamps are ideal—keeps hands free
- Avoid opening the refrigerator (more on this below)

### 4. Check on Vulnerable People
- Elderly neighbors
- Those dependent on medical equipment
- Families with infants

## Lighting: Safe Options for the Dark

Not all light sources are created equal in a power outage.

### Recommended (Safe)

| Light Source | Pros | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| **LED Flashlights** | Bright, long battery life | Keep extras in every room |
| **Headlamps** | Hands-free | Essential for tasks |
| **Battery lanterns** | Area lighting | Great for rooms |
| **Glow sticks** | No fire risk, kid-safe | Single use |
| **Solar lights** | Bring outdoor lights inside | Free to recharge |

### Use with Caution

| Light Source | Risk | Safety Rules |
|--------------|------|--------------|
| **Candles** | Fire hazard | Never leave unattended, keep away from curtains |
| **Oil lamps** | Fire, fumes | Use in ventilated areas only |
| **Propane lanterns** | Carbon monoxide | Outdoor use ONLY |

**Fire safety reminder:** More home fires start during power outages than any other time. If using candles, place them in sturdy holders on stable surfaces, away from anything flammable.

## Food Safety: The Refrigerator Rules

Your refrigerator becomes a ticking clock the moment power goes out.

### Keep It Closed

Every time you open the door, you lose cold air. An unopened refrigerator keeps food safe for **4 hours**. An unopened freezer maintains temperature for **24-48 hours** (depending on how full it is).

### The Temperature Danger Zone

Food becomes unsafe when it enters the "danger zone" between 40°F and 140°F.

| Appliance | Safe Duration (Unopened) |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Refrigerator | 4 hours |
| Full freezer | 48 hours |
| Half-full freezer | 24 hours |

### When Power Returns

**Check temperatures:**
- If fridge is above 40°F for more than 2 hours, discard perishables
- If frozen food still has ice crystals, it can be refrozen
- When in doubt, throw it out

**Foods to discard after 4+ hours above 40°F:**
- Raw or cooked meat, poultry, fish
- Milk, soft cheeses, yogurt
- Opened baby formula
- Cut fruits and vegetables
- Cooked pasta, rice, potatoes

**Foods that stay safe:**
- Hard cheeses
- Butter, margarine
- Fresh whole fruits and vegetables
- Condiments (mustard, ketchup, pickles)
- Bread, bagels, tortillas
- Peanut butter, jelly

## Staying Warm (Winter Outages)

Cold weather outages are dangerous. Hypothermia can occur indoors when temperatures drop.

### Immediate Steps

1. **Close off unused rooms** - Concentrate body heat in one area
2. **Seal drafts** - Towels under doors, blankets over windows
3. **Layer clothing** - Multiple thin layers beat one thick layer
4. **Stay dry** - Wet clothing rapidly accelerates heat loss

### Safe Heat Sources

| Source | Safety Level | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Body heat** | Safe | Huddle together under blankets |
| **Hand warmers** | Safe | Place in pockets, gloves |
| **Sleeping bags** | Safe | Rated for low temps |
| **Wood fireplace** | Caution | Only if properly maintained |

### NEVER Use Indoors

- Gas ovens or stovetops for heating
- Charcoal or propane grills
- Generators
- Outdoor propane heaters
- Camp stoves

**Carbon monoxide kills.** It's odorless and colorless. Every year, people die from running generators or grills indoors during outages. Just don't do it.

## Staying Cool (Summer Outages)

Heat emergencies kill more people than any other weather event. Without AC, temperatures can become dangerous quickly.

### Cooling Strategies

1. **Go low** - Hot air rises; ground floors and basements are cooler
2. **Close blinds** - Block solar heat gain
3. **Open windows at night** - Cross-ventilation when outdoor temps drop
4. **Wet towels** - Place on neck, wrists, forehead
5. **Stay hydrated** - Drink water even if not thirsty

### Watch for Heat Illness

| Condition | Symptoms | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Heat cramps** | Muscle pain, spasms | Rest, drink water, cool down |
| **Heat exhaustion** | Heavy sweating, weakness, nausea | Move to cool area, hydrate, cool skin |
| **Heat stroke** | High temp, confusion, no sweating | **Call 911 immediately** |

### Know When to Leave

If indoor temperatures exceed 95°F and you can't cool down, go somewhere with power:
- Cooling centers (check local emergency management)
- Malls, libraries, movie theaters
- Friends or family with power

## Communication and Information

When the power's out, information becomes critical.

### Your Lifeline: Battery/Crank Radio

Cell towers have backup power, but it's limited. Internet goes down. TV is useless. A NOAA weather radio may be your only source of official information.

**Must-have features:**
- NOAA weather band
- Hand crank AND battery backup
- Flashlight built-in
- Phone charging port (bonus)

### Preserve Phone Battery

Your smartphone is precious—treat its battery accordingly:

- **Lower brightness** to minimum
- **Enable airplane mode** when not actively using
- **Disable background apps**
- **Turn off Bluetooth, WiFi, location**
- **Use for essential communication only**
- **Power off completely** if outage will be extended

### Stay Informed

- Local emergency management social media (before phones die)
- NOAA weather radio
- Battery-powered AM/FM radio
- Text updates from utility company

**Pro tip:** Text messages use less battery and get through when calls can't. Text "OUT" to your utility's outage number if they have one.

## Medical Considerations

Power outages can be life-threatening for those with medical needs.

### Medications

- **Refrigerated meds** (insulin): Use cooler with ice, use within guidelines
- **Nebulizers, CPAP**: Have battery backup or manual alternatives
- **Oxygen concentrators**: Contact supplier for backup plan

### Medical Equipment

| Equipment | Backup Plan |
|-----------|-------------|
| Oxygen concentrator | Portable tanks, notify supplier |
| CPAP | Battery backup unit |
| Refrigerated meds | Cooler with ice, know time limits |
| Electric wheelchair | Keep charged, manual backup |
| Home dialysis | Contact provider for facility backup |

### Register with Your Utility

Most power companies maintain a "medical baseline" or "life support" registry. Registered customers get:
- Priority restoration
- Advance notice of planned outages
- Wellness checks during extended outages

## Generator Safety

If you have a generator, use it correctly or not at all.

### Critical Rules

1. **NEVER run indoors** - Not in garage, basement, or near windows
2. **Place 20+ feet from home** - Exhaust must not enter
3. **Never refuel while running** - Turn off, let cool first
4. **Use heavy-duty extension cords** - Rated for outdoor use
5. **Don't backfeed** - Never plug into wall outlet (electrocution risk to lineworkers)

### What to Power

Prioritize essential loads:
- Refrigerator/freezer
- Medical equipment
- Sump pump (if flooding risk)
- A few lights
- Phone charging

- Water or sewer systems also affected
- Vulnerable family members at risk

Have a destination in mind before you need it. Family, friends, hotels outside the affected area, or official shelters.

- [ ] Reset clocks and timers
- [ ] Check sump pump operation
- [ ] Restart medical equipment

## The Bottom Line

Power outages are inevitable. Extended outages are increasingly common. But with basic preparation and knowledge, an outage becomes an inconvenience, not an emergency.

The family that has flashlights, a radio, and a plan isn't panicking in the dark. They're playing cards by lantern light, checking on neighbors, and waiting it out safely.

**Be Prepared. Stay Safe. Live Free.**
