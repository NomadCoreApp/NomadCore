# About NomadCore

## We Built This Because We Needed It

In 2024, Texas got hit hard. Storms. Hurricanes. Floods. Power out for days. Roads impassable. Cell towers down.

Like a lot of people, I found myself searching for an app—something that could tell me what to do, help me track my supplies, and actually work when the internet didn't.

I found plenty of apps. None of them worked offline. Most wanted subscriptions. All of them wanted my data.

So I built what I was looking for.

## Who's Behind This

I'm a product development engineer in the medical device industry. I spend my days creating technology that helps people—devices that save lives in hospitals and clinics around the world.

I'm also a developer, an outdoorsman, and a parent.

NomadCore started as a side project in mid-2025. What began as an AI proof-of-concept quickly became something more: a tool I actually wanted to use. A tool my family could depend on.

When I realized that "AI-powered" usually means "sends your data to corporate servers," I made a choice. I moved to locally-stored, hardcoded survival data—information that works without internet and stays on your device by default.

If you choose to create an account for backup and sync, your data is stored securely—but the app works fully offline without one. When local AI models catch up, NomadCore will evolve. But it will never sell your data or harvest it for ads.

## What We Believe

**Privacy matters.**
Your emergency plans, your family's information, your location—that's yours. Not ours. Not anyone's.

**Preparedness is for everyone.**
You don't have to be a "prepper" to want your family safe. You just have to care.

**Technology should work when you need it most.**
An app that requires internet during an emergency isn't an emergency app. It's a liability.

**Family safety comes first.**
Every feature we build starts with one question: "Would this help protect my family?"

## The Name

Lost Pines Creative LLC is based in Texas, named after the Lost Pines forest—a unique stand of loblolly pines separated from their East Texas relatives by 100 miles of prairie. They adapted. They survived. They thrived where they weren't supposed to be.

That's the spirit behind everything we build.

## The Mission

**Everyone deserves access to survival knowledge.**

Not locked behind paywalls. Not dependent on cell towers. Not harvesting your data in exchange for "free" features.

NomadCore puts military-grade survival information, emergency planning tools, and supply tracking in your pocket—and keeps it there, even when everything else fails.

No subscriptions. No data harvesting. No corporate overlords.

Just tools that work when you need them most.

## Be Prepared. Stay Safe. Live Free.

That's not just a tagline. It's why we show up every day.
